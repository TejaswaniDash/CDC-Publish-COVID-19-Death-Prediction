# CDC-Publish-COVID-19-Death-Prediction

The provided code seems to be related to predictive modeling for COVID-19 outcomes based on biomarkers and clinical data. Let's break down the code and its relevance to the CDC published COVID-19 deaths by place of death and age.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The code begins with loading the training and test datasets from Excel files.
The data undergoes preprocessing steps such as filling missing values, sorting by relevant columns, and extracting features like time in hospital from admission and discharge times.
Various visualizations like bar plots and count plots are used to explore the data distribution and understand the outcome classes.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated using the training data.
Models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression are used.
The accuracy of each model is evaluated using the test dataset, and the results are printed.

Feature Selection:
Feature selection techniques such as XGBoost are applied to identify important biomarkers for predicting COVID-19 outcomes.
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are used to explain the model's predictions based on selected features.

Prediction Using Selected Features:
Top features selected from the XGBoost feature selection model are used to make predictions using Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM models.
Cross-validation is performed to evaluate the models' performance using the selected features.

Model Comparison and Visualization:
The accuracy of different models is compared using box plots and bar plots.
Results from different models are displayed for comparison.

The relevance to the CDC published COVID-19 deaths by place of death and age can be understood as follows:
The dataset used in this code likely contains clinical data and biomarkers of COVID-19 patients, which could include information such as age, comorbidities, laboratory test results, and outcomes (e.g., recovery or death).
By analyzing and modeling this data, the code aims to predict COVID-19 outcomes (such as mortality) based on the available features.
Insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding the factors that contribute to COVID-19 mortality, including the role of specific biomarkers and clinical indicators.
This information can be valuable for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in better managing and mitigating the impact of COVID-19, especially in different age groups and settings (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities).

Overall, the code demonstrates a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting COVID-19 outcomes using machine learning techniques, which aligns with the broader goal of leveraging data analytics to address public health challenges, as emphasized by organizations like the CDC.
